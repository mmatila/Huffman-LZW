# Week 1

### 5-6 hours of work

After hours of being all over the place with the idea for the project, I finally came to a conclusion: Huffman coding & LZW algorithm. This first week aka the past few days have pretty much only consisted of getting a good overview of what I'm about to be working on. This includes watching some YouTube videos and reading some articles. I didn't start writing any code yet but that will happen in the near future. 

Some key takes from watching videos and reading articles about data compressing and these two specific techniques to do it taught me quite a bit. First of all, I had no clue how data compressing even works. Now after doing some research, it seems reasonably "simple". By simple I mean that the whole concept and implementation of it doesn't seem too complex, hence the idea to work on two algorithms rather than just one.

What comes to next week, I really need to go back and read through some theory about data structures since it's been a while I've played with them. Also need to recall some basic Java stuff since the past few months I've only been working with JS and Python. Goal is to get properly started on building the project and having a clear idea of what kind of methods and classes I'm going to be using. As mentioned in the specification, I won't be stressing about self-made data structures just yet but rather focus on having a working program with Java's own quirks and later in the course start converting them into my own implementations.

One question I'd like to ask is how important is implementing the most optimal algorithm? So should I rather just work on Huffman and make it as optimized as possible OR focus on both Huffman and LZW even if I don't have the time to make either of them super optimal (time complexity wise)?
