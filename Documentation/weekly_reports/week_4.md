# Week 4

### 15 hours of work  

This week I had some good progress! Managed to get LZW fully working and Huffman is only missing the decoding part. Wanted to take a break from algorithmic thinking
for a bit and instead of implementing the decoding for Huffman, I managed to implement a working custom ArrayList as well as custom HashMap, which is only missing
the remove method. Still lacking on tests which is quite unfortunate but I'm sure I'll get to them eventually.  I've tried to keep the code as clean as I can, but
for now there's still a bunch of prints that I'm using as my tests (added a "performance test" screenshot in test documentation)

Next week I'll try to work on some of the following: decoding for Huffman, min heap implementation or figuring how to get rid of BitSet.
