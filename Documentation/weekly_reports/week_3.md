# Week 3

### 3 hours of work

This week I literally did not find the time to properly work on the project, so I decided to spend the little time I had on "researching". Unfortunately though, I
still didn't quite figure out how to convert the long string of 1s and 0s into bytes.. :/ I watched some videos and tried to get a hang of how Jussi made it in his
[project](https://github.com/yussiv/Compress), with no result. 

I still have a quite clear vision of what to do, so I'm not too worried that I didn't get stuff done this week. I'll "catch up" as much as I can next week so I don't fall
behind the recommended schedule. So my plan for next week is to figure out the byte-problem and continue from there.
