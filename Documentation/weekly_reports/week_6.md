# Week 6

### 15 hours of work 

Had some major issues while trying to change my program to use my own HashMap implementation instead of the Java HashMap. This took quite a chunk from this week's hours but I'm
happy I finally managed to get it to work. Right after solving that problem I was able to detect what slowed down my Huffman encoding and fixed it. There's still ways to improve
it, at least compared to the project I peer reviewed this week. Also was able to get rid of BitSet which means that the program is now fully using my self-made data structures.

Next week I'll finish up the Huffman decoding and try and make the UI fully functional. Then I can just focus on doing all kinds of tests and writing some proper documentation
before the demos and final submission. I'm positive I'll have a good project overall by the 19th.
