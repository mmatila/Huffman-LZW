# Week 5

### 10 hours of work  

Very busy week work-wise and barely had any time to put into the project. With the little hours I had, I managed to implement a working PriorityQueue. HashMap
turned out to be a pain to get to work. And does it work now? No. I will need to think whether I'll keep the HashMap implementation as it is now and get it to work
OR completely change the structure of the project. Had a very well made Huffman to peer review this week and it kinda inspired me to change things up a little,
since my own project seems very messy compared to it.  

I'm afraid I won't have much more time next week either but I need to switch up the gear to make sure I'll have this ready in time. I'd LOVE to have a working
program by next Friday but we'll see.
